        <p >Organic farmers and food producers grow and produce food without using synthetic chemicals such as pesticides and artificial fertilisers.<br>
            They do not use genetically modified (GM) components or expose food to irradiation.<br>
             Animal welfare and environmental sustainability are important issues for organic farmers.

            <p>Organic matter, organic material, or natural organic matter refers to the large source of carbon-based compounds <br>
                found within natural and engineered, terrestrial, and aquatic environments.<br>
                It is matter composed of organic compounds that have come from the feces and remains of organisms such as plants and animals.</p>

            <p>The definition of organic cosmetics is simple: it is a beauty product made from natural and organic ingredients. Specifically,<br>
             organic cosmetics consist of ingredients cultivated without pesticides, herbicides,<br>
            and other harmful chemicals to both health and the planet</p>
            The USDA requirements for the use of the term “organic” are separate from <br>
            the laws and regulations that FDA enforces for cosmetics. Cosmetic products labeled with organic claims must comply <br>
            with both USDA regulations for the organic claim and FDA regulations for labeling and safety requirements for cosmetics  
            <p>
                Products labeled as “100% organic” must contain only organically produced ingredients and processing aids, excluding water and salt. <br>
                No other ingredients or additives are permitted. <br>
                Products labeled “organic” must contain at least 95% organically produced ingredients (excluding water and salt).
